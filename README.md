# BSFree Archive

**Preview Link: https://andrewmackrodt.github.io/bsfree/**

Archive of cheat codes from [bsfree.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225044111/http://bsfree.org/). This was
created from a MySQL dump I found on Discord and ported to SQLite. Some codes have been removed where I was unable to
determine what the correct game, system or device they were associated with. The snapshot from archive.org in Feb 2021
claims to have 2,116,065 codes compared to this repo which contains 2,106,109 (>99.5%).

The SQLite database is hosted [here](https://static.mackrodt.io/files/bsfree.4cfee26.db) if you wish to download
it. [sql.js-httpvfs](https://github.com/phiresky/sql.js-httpvfs) is used to avoid needing a backend when performing
database queries.
